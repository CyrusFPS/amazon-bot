Amazon bot to buy products using Puppeteerjs

Extremely buggy, but it mostly works. If I were to continue work on the project, I would be totally capable of refining it. 
The functionallity part made with puppeteer is kafkaesque, most parts are unnecessarily complicated as I never bothered to refactor it after botching it together.
The website and UI is some of my best work yet, and I actually enjoyed the CSS for once. My skills are most certainly improving in that area.
Proud of the project, probably won't maintain or work on it any longer though.
